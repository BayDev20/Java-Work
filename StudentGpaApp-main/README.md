# Student GPA Program

This Java program allows users to input student data (name, address, and GPA) via the command line. The data is then stored in a linked list, sorted alphabetically by student name, and written to a text file.

## Features

- Prompt user for student data interactively.
- Validate GPA input to ensure it falls within the range [0, 4.5].
- Store student objects in a linked list.
- Sort student list by name.
- Write sorted student data to a text file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   https://github.com/BayDev20/GPA.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
```bash
javac StudentGrades.java
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
java StudentGrades
```
4. Follow the prompts to enter student data. Type "exit" as the student name to finish data entry.

5. Once data entry is complete, the program will generate a text file named `student_list.txt` in the same directory, containing the sorted student data.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Git (optional, if you're cloning the repository)
